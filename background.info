PREAMBLE: This is kinda long, but, it's kinda important. Feedback is requested. We're more or less gonna tell the board what to do and how to do it, so we gotta do it well 

SITUATION: Voting for new board members

BACKGROUND: Our board voted in May to add two new seats on the board -- one elected by individual members and one by corporate members.  Currently the board is composed of 5 seats; two elected by individual members, two by corporate members, and the 1 by the founding members.  This number has made quorum kinda tricky and ⅔ majority really means 4/5th's.  The maths of a 7 person board will be logistically more efficient.  

The current representatives for our class are Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen.  The requirements to serve on the board are rather simple.  Board members must have a real name and an address.   I think they request a background check for felonies…that's about it.  Nominees (and board members) do not need to be members of the Bitcoin Foundation, although it is expected that they join as individual members if elected.  

ACTION: I spoke with Peter, Lindsay, and Zlatko on the phone this evening and we're soliciting feedback on this rough sketch of a plan:
NOMINATING:
Just about anyone can be nominated (self nominations ok) and many high quality nominations are sought.  There will be a proof of work to keep the number of nominations manageable  The proposed proof of work is for the nominated person to print, fill, sign, and mail a form (like on real physical paper) to Lindsay.  Something like the attached.   BitcoinFoundationNomineeAcceptanceForm.pdf   119.46K   12 downloads

Nominees must: 1) be real, 2) have a physical address, 3) be willing to serve, and 4) not be a felon.  There are otherwise no restrictions.  Nominees do not need to be members of the Bitcoin Foundation (although it would be dashed awkward if they did get elected but didn't join the organization they'd be helping to lead; if finances truly preclude the winner from joining, I'll pay for it).  There are no geographic, linguistic, religious, political, gender or philosophical restrictions on who can be nominated.   I guess they should be at least18 years old, but, I'm not certain that's a requirement.  If someone wants to nominate a minor, send me a message.

CAMPAIGNING:
One proposal was to have a stickied? / locked? thread on the Bitcoin Foundation forum.  Nominees would be added to the thread on a first come, first serve basis, and would be able to post a brief bio/platform and two links to their own threads.  We also think that opening a thread on Bitcointalk.org is a good idea, but we really want feedback on this one.  While only Foundation members can vote, my feeling is that it is best to cast as wide a net as possible to help us get the best candidates possible.  Thoughts?

VOTING:
How are we gonna vote?  I propose we use http://heliosvoting.org/  This comes on the advice of fellow member Charles Hoskinson (who himself knows a thing or two about fully homomorphic encryption techniques) and helios can provide us with an "anonymous", secure, and fully auditable election.  By "anonymous" I mean you will be assigned a random identifier (pseudonym) and given a ballot tracking key (via email; plan is to use the email addresses on file with the Foundation).  Everyone will be able to verify their vote as accurate and be able to verify that no one voted twice. No one will be able to know which pseudonym voted for which candidate (unless it's your own).  Peter kinda knows the guys behind helios too (he told me he knew them about 10-15 yrs ago). Anyhow, helios offers real encryption and they seem very legit (see http://heliosvoting....sked-questions/).  

If we get a lot of nominations, I think we should do run-off elections.  If like 20 people (or 50) get nominated, that's too much work for me to look at all the candidates in depth, so having a few a few rounds to narrow the field might be a good idea (and give extra time for the stronger candidates to campaign).  

TIMELINE: (We mostly made this up based on the "yeah, that will probably work" method; nothing is set in stone)
Nominating Deadline: 01 August
Voting for Round #1: 01 September
Voting Round Duration: 1 week
Ballot Stuffing Prevention: Must register as a Foundation member by 8/23 to vote

RESPONSE:  The board will meet July 1st as previously arranged.  We need to advise the board on what we think they should do as far as elections go.  

That should give us enough time to discuss the above and formulate a plan. When we feel we've got a good plan, I'll type up the proposal and send it to Lindsay.  My goal is to have a plan so good that accepting it will be easier than coming up with a better one 

Your thoughts, feedback, comments, etc. are respectfully requested.  Thanks all. 

DECISIONS FOR US TO MAKE:
0) Getting the word out on the vote vs. getting the word out on planning to vote. I'm personally comfortable with not working extra hard to solicit people's opinions who don't normally visit here. I think an outreach email for the less frequent visitors announcing the final voting plans is appropriate. My efforts will be more task focused, it will be up to others to get the word out on our open election committee process.
1) ConsiderIt.us -- a combo voting system and campaigning platform (think FaceBook technology merged with electronic voting). I think this will facilitate discussion and lead to a better informed electorate and thus I strongly favor this idea (rather than providing no campaigning support beyond a thread or two).  Other idea: Helios voting? Seems cheap, easy, private, secure. Other idea: Electionbuddy.com; seems hokey. Other idea: ElectionServicesCorp; seems über professional and is surprisingly cheap (ball park $3,000). Post card in the mail will also let us verify our own members; this will help prevent ballot stuffers. Consider getting professional advice from UM prof / hacker.
2) Run off elections? We could rank candidate preference and do instant run off, or just take the winner after the first round.
3) Voting dates/durations? Is a week long enough to have the polls open? The dates were picked with little thought, does anyone see a big issue there? Does the anti-ballot stuffing idea sound good? My concern is that it wouldn't take much cash for someone to buy more votes than we constitute (although it's one member, one vote, we do not have a way to enforce it...we already have falsified accounts among us. We could verify members before the election, but that's a fair amount if work, and I'm not sure how we could do it).
4) Does the proof of work (mailing a form) sound reasonable? The goal is to filter out those who can't perform work from being nominated...but, for all I know it costs like $20 to send a letter to the US from where some of our members are from (40% are not from the US). I do not want money to prevent someone from running.
5) Do we want to target anyone in particular for nomination? Do we want to allow anyone to nominate, or make a rule that anyone nominated by a non-member needs to be seconded by a member?



If we go with the plan as outlined above, we will need volunteers to:
0) Todd has graciously agreed to post some shell documents that should help us in soliciting candidates (like job description, expectations, etc)
1) Make/update the bitcointalk thread.
2) Create the subreddit.
3) Perhaps someone to audit the election.


Other issues (older):
I just thought that we might need an official start time for nominations to begin so we know who was nominated first, second, third, etc.
